# «چقدر؟» — Cheghadr

**A native Android market tracker for Iranian and international markets.**

Cheghadr («چقدر؟» — *“How much?”*) tracks currencies, gold, coins, cryptocurrencies
and more with one non-negotiable rule: **every price discloses its source and its
age.** No invented numbers, no fake fallbacks.

- **Native** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Material 3) — not a WebView, not a wrapper.
- **Persian-first**: RTL layout, Vazirmatn typography, Jalali dates, Persian
  digits by default — with complete English localization.
- **Honest data**: live, keyless sources (CoinPaprika, open.er-api, Frankfurter,
  gold-api.com) plus Iranian free-market rates scraped on-device from tgju.org
  (toggleable in Settings).
- **Customizable dashboard**: reorder/hide sections, pin featured assets,
  compact or comfortable density, optional mini charts — all persisted locally.
- **Useful offline**: Room-cached quotes render instantly and are marked stale;
  favorites, alerts and settings persist locally.
- **Android-native extras**: home-screen widgets (Glance), price alerts with
  quiet hours, WorkManager-backed sync with exponential backoff, CSV/JSON
  export of portfolio, history and backups (no secrets ever leave the device).
